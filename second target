the second target for me is to write a clean code, with good API. my documentation is really bad, and i usually dont document at all (because im the only one who views my own code)
i really want to change that, so my target is to teach myself writing a clean,understandable code during the course- its a big opportunity for me to learn and to get a good feedback
from other students.
